<section id="ABOUT">
    <br><h1>ABOUT</h1>Hello! I’m Ibrahim, and I’m currently studying Doctor Pharmacy (DPharm) at DUHS. My passion for the healthcare field drives my academic pursuits, and I’m excited about the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of medicines, health sciences, and patient care. I’m looking forward to applying what I learn in the future to make a positive impact on people's lives.

        Before my current studies, I completed my Intermediate from Government Delhi College, where I achieved excellent grades. I also graduated from The Country School with A1 grades in my Matriculation, a time when my love for academics truly blossomed. I was known as a “nerd” in school—not because I didn’t enjoy other activities, but because I was always deeply invested in learning and excelling in my studies.
        
        Outside of academics, I am passionate about volunteering and giving back to the community. Over the years, I’ve been involved in various volunteer activities, where I contributed to organizing events, spreading awareness on health-related issues, and supporting meaningful causes. Volunteering has helped me connect with others and taught me valuable lessons about empathy and teamwork.
        
        Another hobby of mine is calligraphy. I find relaxation and creativity in the art of beautiful handwriting, experimenting with different styles and techniques. It’s a fun and peaceful way for me to express myself outside the classroom.
        
        I am always eager to learn new things and challenge myself, whether it's through my studies, volunteer work, or hobbies. I’m committed to growing both personally and professionally, and I hope to continue making a positive difference wherever I go.
        
        Thank you for visiting my page and learning more about me. If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!.</p>
